# Restore Runbook

## Backrest UI

Backrest owns this repository. Prefer browsing snapshots and restoring files
from:

```text
https://backups.internal.therealrishabh.com
```

## Restore A Service State Directory

Use Backrest to restore into a temporary directory first, inspect the restored
files, then stop the affected service and replace its live state directory.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop vaultwarden.service
```

Do not overwrite live state without inspecting the restored files first.
